Welcome to my Tudor England! My story revolves around King Henry, his wives, and his children. There are 4 characters, each character has a different story. You guys are able to choose any characters you guys like, and discover the mysterious stories of your chosen character. You can become a farmer working on a farm. You will experience many things on the farm such as herding sheep, cows, and pigs. You can be a king and find out which wife gave birth a son, or you can find out what your childhood was like. You can view a character's portrait and learn more about them by clicking on the references. This project is an interactive story created with Twine. Some pages are colorful, have different font styles with color, images, variables, inputs, etc. You guys can learn a lot of information about the history of these characters after playing my story. Creating a story in Twine, it is a new skill for me. I learn how to use if/then/else statement, using input, variable, add color, change fonts, highlights, linking the passage, etc. ok
